# React Native SDK for OpenIM üë®‚Äçüíªüí¨


Here is the updated description for the React Native SDK for adding instant messaging capabilities using the OpenIM SDK:

**React Native OpenIM SDK**

The React Native OpenIM SDK empowers your application with instant messaging capabilities, making it easier than ever to integrate real-time communication features. By connecting to a self-hosted OpenIM server, you can seamlessly infuse your app with instant messaging functionality using just a few lines of code.

**Key Features:**

Cross-Platform Support: The underlying OpenIM SDK Core is implemented in OpenIM SDK Core. It offers versatile integration options for different platforms.

Android Integration with AAR Files: For Android integration, the OpenIM SDK Core can be compiled into an AAR (Android Archive) file using gomobile. Android applications interact with the OpenIM SDK Core through JSON, and the SDK offers a user-friendly API. Data storage on Android is seamlessly managed using the internal SQLite layer provided by the OpenIM SDK Core.

iOS Integration with XCFramework: On iOS, the OpenIM SDK Core can be compiled into an XCFramework for smooth integration. iOS applications communicate with the OpenIM SDK Core via JSON, and the SDK simplifies usage with its re-encapsulated API. Data storage on iOS leverages the internal SQLite layer provided by the OpenIM SDK Core.

Empower your application with instant messaging capabilities across web, Android, and iOS platforms, and enhance user engagement with real-time communication using the React Native OpenIM SDK.

For detailed integration instructions, refer to the OpenIM SDK Core documentation.
